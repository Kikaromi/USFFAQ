	"answers": {
		"snowA": "The kinds of days that are way too cold that no sane person would want to go outside. You know the kind-- 12 inches of snow, -10 degrees fahrenheit, the works. Makes you almost wish you lived somewhere warmer, but then you'll have heat troubles instead. Gotta love weather that way; never works in the way you wanted it to. But hey, them's the human condition and we just got to deal with whatever our environment gives us. Regardless of how painful it may be.",
		
		"skyA": "Technically the sky is blue, but thanks to our friend the sun, the sun can change colors. While it is still ultimately blue to us, light can reflect to make it look reddish or the lack of light can make it practically pitch black. And then there's clouds to block out the true color of the sky and rain on your parade, pun intended.",
		
		"kikaromiA": "I'd love to say there's a profound meaning to the goofy name I've subjected you all to, but there really isn't. It was a name that I made up back when I was still in grade school and I've used it since then. To me it has a good ring to it and I get sick of people saying 'Alexandria' when it's 'Alexandra'. Kika/Kikaromi works for me.",
		
		"amtA": "10 full questions of varying length. And you've got the shortest one here.",
		
		"longA": "Depends when I run out of rambling nonsense to say per question. As of writing this, I'm just writing what comes into my head and typing it out to fill space. And since we've got to account for possible huge answers as some of the questions Jennifer gives us might be complex, the best way to substitute that is to have a question that seemingly goes on forever. For our sakes, I don't hope every single question ends up as long as some of the ones I'm making in this testing text file, but lord knows what kinds of questions will they want from the policy. So just to be safe, here I am. On the road again. Quoting random songs that come into my head. You could say that You Never Saw It Coming. Persona 5 memes.",
		
		"jobA": "At this point, even I'm not all that sure. I may act as the aux coder for whenever one needs me while also doubling as the hard end police chief who says to get X or Y done and keeping communication at a high so nobody is confused waiting for someone else and they aren't responding. But even then, I don't know if that'd work for me. Sorry for being a dead weight OTL",
		
		"realA": "As of writing this, I sent her an e-mail ~9 days ago and got a response ~7 days ago and from then it's been silence. I'll be sure to e-mail her again to put on a little pressure so she doesn't take up until late Feburary for us to not work with the actual questions but we'll see how that pans out. For the time being, this should work as a substitute for formatting and the like.",
		
		"welA": "Honestly I hear people talk such smack to her and I haven't really experienced all the bad stuff I've heard about between us. Sure there's been times she's told me how much I fail at life and I got a bit upset but otherwise she's been relatively nice to me. Not sure if I managed to tickle the 'nicer' Weldon or something but I guess we'll just never know",
		
		"runA": "Yes. Yes I am. I'm trying to finish this by the time class ends and that's obviously not happening. But I tried.",
		
		"tenthA": "Not much. Just a 'you have escaped me' and put this on the github.",
