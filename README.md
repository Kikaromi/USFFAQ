# The USF ASC Policy FAQ App

Welcome to the USF ASC FAQ Phone Application ~~Un~~official GitHub!

This GitHub was used to test the Application itself until a __*permanent*__ location for the files itself was chosen and an apk was created.

Once the final product is delivered, it will also act as a file back-up should any server issues terminate the files or any major bugs cause the application to cease functioning. 

If there are any questions regarding the GitHub, contact the owner, @Kikaromi, within GitHub itself or at kikaromi@gmail.com
